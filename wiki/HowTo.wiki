#summary General information

= Installation =

* Download newest file: https://code.google.com/p/rutorrent-stream-plugin/downloads/list
* Extract in your rutorrent plugins folder (perhaps /var/www/rutorrent/plugins)
* It should work, but you need to change some settings in VLC for better performance

= VLC Settings =

Open the settings menu (Tools->Preferences), click all/advanced
Then under Input/Codecs, under access modules, click HTTP(S).

* Change caching value to 19200 (you can use higher if it still buffers)
* Check the box 'auto re-connect'.


= Server Settings =

Only file to edit is config.php

You can add your username/password if you use http (basic) auth, so that it automatically logs in so you do not have to enter it in VLC each time.

If your webserver is nginx, you can add a location to your server block:
<pre>location ^~ /stream/ {
        internal;
        alias /;
}</pre>
and change USE_NGINX in config.php to true

so that you can pause / skip forward/back in the streams.
